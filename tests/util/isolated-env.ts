/**
 * Windows-aware test isolation helper.
 *
 * `tests/setup-home.ts` only sets HOME/USERPROFILE/HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH. That's
 * enough on POSIX where session state is `~/.{adapter}/...`, but on Windows
 * `getMultiAdapterLifetimeStats`, OpenCode's `getConfigDir`, and the bun
 * runtime fallbacks read `%APPDATA%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`,
 * `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `TEMP`, `TMP` directly. Without
 * isolating those, real adapter dirs leak into render output and PR #515's
 * BRAND_NEW assertion fails on the windows-latest runner.
 *
 * Usage in-process (mutation + restore):
 *
 *     import "../setup-home.js";              // installs node:os mock
 *     import { withIsolatedEnv } from "../util/isolated-env.js";
 *     const { fakeHome, restore } = withIsolatedEnv();
 *     try { ... } finally { restore(); }
 *
 * Usage as subprocess `env` payload (no global mutation, no os mock needed):
 *
 *     import { buildIsolatedEnvObject } from "../util/isolated-env.js";
 *     const { fakeHome, env } = buildIsolatedEnvObject();
 *     spawnSync("node", [STATUSLINE], { env: { ...process.env, ...env } });
 *
 * Both paths produce identical key sets so a test can swap between in-process
 * and subprocess patterns without the env contract drifting.
 *
 * The `node:os` mock is installed by importing `tests/setup-home.ts` (which
 * uses `vi.mock("node:os")` — the only ESM-safe way to redirect `homedir()` /
 * `tmpdir()` from JS code that imports them as named exports). The mock reads
 * from `currentFakeHome` below, which `withIsolatedEnv()` rewrites in-place.
